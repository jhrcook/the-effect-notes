# Chapter 7. Drawing Causal Diagrams

## 7.1 Our idea of the world

- need to do research on the topic in order to understand the system

## 7.2 Thinking through the data generating process

- need to isolate just the relevant factors
    - cannot build a model of the entire world

## 7.3 Simplify

- once a causal diagram has been constructed, look for places to simplify
    - removing some minor details may make the model easier to interpret and thus more useful
- look for the following characteristics:
    1. *unimportance*: likely to have a small/negligible effect
    1. *redundancy*: variables that occupy the same space in the model (they have the same inputs and outputs); often best to combine these variables
    1. *mediators*: mediators that only exist to link two other observed variables can usually be dropped
    1. *irrelevance*: requires knowledge about the system; can be identified by looking for variables that do not have a path to the outcome variables

## 7.4 Avoiding cycles

- a causal diagram cannot have cycles
    - cannot start from one variable, fallow any connections, and eventually return to the original variable
- this would mean that a variable causes itself
- many cases that seem contrary to this remain consistent when you recall that the events are organized in time

## 7.5 Getting comfortable with assumptions

- assumptions appear in the diagram because of missing knowledge
    - can never know everything, so there will always be assumptions
- recommendation is to be critical and reasonable
    - open to criticism from others â€“ may be able to fill in the gaps of missing knowledge
- there are various ways of testing some types of assumptions, too, that will be covered later
