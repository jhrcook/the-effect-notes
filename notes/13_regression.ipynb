    "\n",
    "- the *exogeneity* assumption: \"If we want to say that our OLS estimates of $\\beta_1$ will, on average, give us the population $\\beta_1$, then it must be the case that $X$ is uncorrelated with $\\epsilon$.\"\n",
    "    - if there is a linear relationship between $X$ and $\\epsilon$, then it is an open back door in the causal diagram\n",
    "    - in other words, the factors implicitly modeled in the error term must not have an effect on $X$\n",
    "- for a normal linear regression, we model the coefficient $\\beta_1$ as a normal distribution with mean $\\beta_1$ and standard deviation $\\sqrt{\\sigma^2 / (\\text{var}(X)n)}$ where $n$ is the number of data points and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the error term $\\epsilon$\n",
    "    - with multiple coefficients in the model, the math requires linear algebra, but the same idea holds\n",
    "    - this standard deviation is really a *standard error* because it is the standard deviation of a sampling distribution\n",
