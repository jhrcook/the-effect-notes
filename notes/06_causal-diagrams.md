# Chapter 6. Causal Diagrams

## 6.1 Causality

- *causal*: does $X$ cause $Y$
    - not just looking for an association, that is *descriptive* research
    - causal language will indicate directionality, not just an association
- definition of causation:

> We can say that $X$ causes $Y$ if, were we to intervene and change the value of $X$, then the distribution of $Y$ would also change as a result.

- specifically changes the distribution of $Y$ because it is a claim about the probability of $Y$
    - leaves room for other factors to be at play

## 6.2 Causal diagrams

- *causal diagrams*: "graphical representation of a data generating process (DGP)"
- contains two components:
    1. nodes: the variables in the DGP
    1. arrows: the causal relationships in the DGP; an arrow from the cause variable to the caused variable
- don't always have access to all of the data, so can include *unobserved variables*
    - have an effect but are not directly measurable themselves
    - also called a *latent variable*


## 6.3 The real world: On an omission mission

- balancing act when constructing a causal diagram between complexity and completeness


## 6.4 Research questions in causal diagrams

- use the diagram to identify which types of variation can identify the research question

## 6.5 Moderators in causal diagrams

- *moderators*: variable that alters how two variables interact; modifies the effect of one variable on another
- to make moderating effects clear in causal diagrams, will include them directly as $X \times Z$ where $X$ modifies $Z$
    - shows there is an *interaction* between $X$ and $Z$
    - this is not always explicit in causal diagrams, but will use this notation in this book
