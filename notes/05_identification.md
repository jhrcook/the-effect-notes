# Chapter 5. Identification

## 5.1 The data generating process

- scientists believe there are general, underlying laws that govern the world
     - we don't observe these directly, instead measure their consequences

## 5.2 Where's your variation

- there are certain parts of the variation in the data that we will use to answer our questions
    - need to account for other sources to isolate the effect we are interested in measuring

## 5.3 Identification

- identifying what part of the variability in the data is meaningful
- link between hypothesis and the data
- requires theory and assumptions about the way the world works in order to think of the contributing sources
    - need to start forming a model of the data generating process
    - often cannot account for all mechanisms you can think of, need to remove those that are irrational or impossible
- :to identify the part of our data that gives the answer to our research question, we must:
    1. Using theory, paint the most accurate picture possible of what the data generating process looks like
    1. Use that data generating process to figure out the reasons our data might look the way it does that does not answer our research question
    1. Find ways to block out those alternate reasons and so dig out the variation we need."

## 5.4 Alcohol and mortality

- demonstration using an alcohol and mortality study

## 5.5 Context and omniscience

- essential to understand how the observed data was collected
